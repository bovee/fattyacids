Some ideas for projects with this dataset:

 1. _Evolutionary Biology_ What correlations are there between taxonomic trees derived from marker genes or whole genome analysis and trees derived from metabolic data like fatty acid abundances? How conserved is membrane lipid composition phylogenetically and how far up the tree of life does this conservation go?

 2. _Environmental Microbiology & Geology_ Can you make up roughly "independent" vectors of lipid compositions at some taxonomic level and then predict the taxonomic composition of a mixed environmental sample solely through analysing lipid abundances? Could you apply this same treatment to a geological sample where this isn't a known truth to determine the taxonomic composition of extinct microbial ecosystems?

 3. _Systems Biology_ What correlations are there between lipid-synthesis genes present in sequenced genomes and actual fatty acid abundances? How much of an organisms membrane composition is set solely through synthetic genes versus regulatory elements, etc.?
